Backend Development:
Programming Languages: Choose a language like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP for server-side development.
Frameworks: Use frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, or Laravel to build the backend logic.
Database: Set up a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user data, posts, and relationships.
Frontend Development:
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Create the user interface using these web technologies.
React, Angular, or Vue.js: Use a frontend framework to build dynamic and responsive pages.

Implement secure user authentication using tools like OAuth, JWT, or Firebase Authentication.
Ensure data privacy and encryption.
Real-time Communication:

Cloud Services:
Host your application on platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
Use services like Amazon S3 for file storage.
APIs:
Create RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend.
Define endpoints for user profiles, posts, comments, and likes.
Mobile App Development (Optional):
Build native or hybrid mobile apps using React Native, Flutter, or Ionic.
Analytics and Monitoring:
Use tools like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Amplitude to track user behavior.
Testing and Debugging:
Employ testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or PHPUnit.
Debug using browser developer tools and server logs.
Scalability and Performance Optimization:
Optimize database queries, use caching (e.g., Redis), and implement load balancing.
Consider using CDNs for content delivery.
Version Control:
Use Git for code management and collaboration.
